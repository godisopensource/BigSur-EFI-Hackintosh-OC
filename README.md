# About
*Note: I have provided an updated (successfull) EFI folder for macOS Ventura 13.0 beta 1 here: https://github.com/godisopensource/Ventura-EFI-Hackintosh-OC/blob/main/README.md*

This folder is my own OpenCore EFI folder that is fully functional for the given system configuration on macOS Big Sur:
- **[Motherboard]** Gigabyte Z390M Gaming
- **[Processor]** Intel i5-9600k (coffee lake)
- **[Graphics Card]** Radeon RX580 8G

# Must dos
For confidentiality reasons, I filled out `Platforminfo` section. You may fill it in with your own generated values.
Also don't forget to **rename the EFI folder from `EFI github` to `EFI`**, otherwise it won't boot.

# Credits
Big thanks to @chris1111 for having provided his OpenCore Creator program: https://github.com/chris1111/OpenCore-Creator

Wish you much success in your Hackintosh experiments!
